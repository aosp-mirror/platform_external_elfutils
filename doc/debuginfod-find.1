.B debuginfod-find [\fIOPTION\fP]... source \fIPATH\fP \fI/FILENAME\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdebuginfod-find\fP queries one or more \fBdebuginfod\fP servers for
debuginfo-related data.  In case of a match, it saves the the
requested file into a local cache, prints the file name to standard
output, and exits with a success status of 0.  In case of any error,
it exits with a failure status and an error message to standard error.

.\" Much of the following text is duplicated with debuginfod.8

The debuginfod system uses buildids to identify debuginfo-related data.
These are stored as binary notes in ELF/DWARF files, and are
represented as lowercase hexadecimal.  For example, for a program
/bin/ls, look at the ELF note GNU_BUILD_ID:

.SAMPLE
% readelf -n /bin/ls | grep -A4 build.id
Note section [ 4] '.note.gnu.buildid' of 36 bytes at offset 0x340:
Owner          Data size  Type
GNU                   20  GNU_BUILD_ID
Build ID: 8713b9c3fb8a720137a4a08b325905c7aaf8429d
.ESAMPLE

Then the hexadecimal BUILDID is simply:

.SAMPLE
8713b9c3fb8a720137a4a08b325905c7aaf8429d
.ESAMPLE

In place of the hexadecimal \fIBUILDID\fP, debuginfod-find also
accepts a path name to to an ELF binary, from which it extracts the
buildid.  In this case, ensure the file name has some character other
than \fB[0-9a-f]\fP.  Files ambiguously named files like
"\fBdeadbeef\fP" can be passed with a \fB./deadbeef\fP extra path
component.


.SS debuginfo \fIBUILDID\fP

If the given buildid is known to a server, this request will result
in a binary object that contains the customary \fB.*debug_*\fP
sections.  This may be a split debuginfo file as created by
\fBstrip\fP, or it may be an original unstripped executable.

.SS executable \fIBUILDID\fP

If the given buildid is known to the server, this request will result
in a binary object that contains the normal executable segments.  This
may be a executable stripped by \fBstrip\fP, or it may be an original
unstripped executable.  \fBET_DYN\fP shared libraries are considered
to be a type of executable.

.SS source \fIBUILDID\fP \fI/SOURCE/FILE\fP

If the given buildid is known to the server, this request will result
in a binary object that contains the source file mentioned.  The path
should be absolute.  Relative path names commonly appear in the DWARF
file's source directory, but these paths are relative to
individual compilation unit AT_comp_dir paths, and yet an executable
is made up of multiple CUs.  Therefore, to disambiguate, debuginfod
expects source queries to prefix relative path names with the CU
compilation-directory, followed by a mandatory "/".

Note: the caller may or may not elide \fB../\fP or \fB/./\fP or extraneous
\fB///\fP sorts of path components in the directory names.  debuginfod
accepts both forms.  Specifically, debuginfod canonicalizes path names
according to RFC3986 section 5.2.4 (Remove Dot Segments), plus reducing
any \fB//\fP to \fB/\fP in the path.

For example:
.TS
l l.
#include <stdio.h>	source BUILDID /usr/include/stdio.h
/path/to/foo.c	source BUILDID /path/to/foo.c
\../bar/foo.c AT_comp_dir=/zoo/	source BUILDID /zoo//../bar/foo.c
.TE

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
.B "\-v"
Increase verbosity, including printing frequent download-progress messages
and printing the http response headers from the server.


.SH "SECURITY"

debuginfod-find \fBdoes not\fP include any particular security
features.  It trusts that the binaries returned by the debuginfod(s)
are accurate.  Therefore, the list of servers should include only
trustworthy ones.  If accessed across HTTP rather than HTTPS, the
network should be trustworthy.  Authentication information through
the internal \fIlibcurl\fP library is not currently enabled, except
for the basic plaintext \%\fIhttp[s]://userid:password@hostname/\fP style.
(The debuginfod server does not perform authentication, but a front-end
proxy server could.)
